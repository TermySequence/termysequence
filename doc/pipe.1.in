.SH NAME
.B @PIPE_NAME@ \"m2rprog
\- send commands and pipe requests to a running
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rdoc
instance

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @PIPE_NAME@
[\fIcommand\fR] [\fIarg...\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @PIPE_NAME@ \"m2rprog
is a command-line interface to certain features of the
.BR @APP_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
graphical multiplexing terminal emulator client.
The primary use of
.B @PIPE_NAME@ \"m2rprog
is to pipe input or output from a remote server, sending the data stream over
the
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol.
A secondary use of
.B @PIPE_NAME@ \"m2rprog
is performing application actions programmatically. See
.B EXAMPLES \"m2rsect
below.

For comprehensive documentation of the many features offered by
.BR @APP_NAME@ , \"m2rdoc
refer to the support pages at https://@PRODUCT_DOMAIN@/doc/

.SH COMMANDS
.IP to\ \fIuser@host\fR
Pipe standard input to a named pipe on the remote server, which must be
connected within
.BR @APP_NAME@ . \"m2rdoc
The
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1)
instance on the remote server will create a named pipe (fifo) which may be used
as standard input to a remote command. The path to the fifo will be printed on
standard error (keep in mind that this path is on the remote server). A "Pipe
To" task will be created within
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rdoc
which may be used to track the status of the upload.

.IP from\ \fIuser@host\fR
Pipe standard output from a named pipe on the remote server. Analogous to the
.I to
command, except with data flowing in the opposite direction. A "Pipe From" task
will be created within
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rdoc
which may be used to track the status of the download.

.IP list-servers
List the currently connected servers.

.IP invoke\ \fIaction...\fR
Run the given application action within the
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rdoc
instance. The format is identical to the "Perform action" key binding, including
arguments separated by vertical bar (|) characters if needed. Quote the action
string if necessary. More than one action string may be given; multiple actions
will be run sequentially.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP --help
Print basic help

.IP --version
Print version information

.IP --man
Attempt to show this man page

.SH FILES
.I $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/@SERVER_NAME@/ \"m2rfile

Location where
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rdoc
creates named pipes.

.I $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/@APP_NAME@/ \"m2rfile

Location of the socket file used by
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rdoc
to accept connections from
.B @PIPE_NAME@ \"m2rprog
(see
.B NOTES \"m2rsect
below).

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP Pipe\ Example
To compute a local
.BR md5sum (1) \"m2rman
of the contents of a file on the connected remote server
.IR user@example.com :
first, execute the local pipe command: \"m2rcode

   $\ @PIPE_NAME@\ from\ user@example.com\ |\ md5sum \"m2rpre
.br \"m2rprebr
   Reading\ from\ /run/user/1000/@SERVER_NAME@/p1 on server user@example.com \"m2rpre

Second, on the remote server, redirect the desired file into the named
pipe: \"m2rcode

   $\ cat foo.dat\ |\ /run/user/1000/@SERVER_NAME@/p1 \"m2rpre

.IP Invoke\ Example
To create a new terminal programmatically,
use: \"m2rcode

   $\ @PIPE_NAME@\ invoke\ NewTerminal \"m2rpre

Or, to create two new terminals using settings profiles Foo and Bar,
use: \"m2rcode

   $\ @PIPE_NAME@\ invoke\ 'NewTerminal|Foo'\ 'NewTerminal|Bar' \"m2rpre

.SH NOTES
If more than one instance of
.BR @APP_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
is run by the user, it is unspecified which instance
.B @PIPE_NAME@ \"m2rprog
will connect to.
