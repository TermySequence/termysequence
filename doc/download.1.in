.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @ABBREV_NAME@-download \"m2rprog
sends one or more files to a terminal running in an instance of
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1). \"m2rdoc
The file data will be kept in the server's memory and can be downloaded by
connected clients.

.I Note:
The
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol supports direct file downloads. For a number of reasons, direct
downloads should generally be preferred over inline downloads using
.BR @ABBREV_NAME@-download . \"m2rprog
See
.B NOTES \"m2rsect
below.

.B @ABBREV_NAME@-imgcat \"m2rprog
sends one or more images to a terminal for inline display. Command line
options can be used to specify the width and height of the image in character
cells and whether names should be printed with the images.
.B @ABBREV_NAME@-imgcat \"m2rprog
uses the
.BR ImageMagick (1) \"m2rman
suite of tools to query the format and dimensions of input images. If the image
dimensions and file size exceed hard-coded thresholds, a thumbnail image will be
generated and uploaded in place of the original.

.B @ABBREV_NAME@-imgls \"m2rprog
produces a long-format directory listing with inline image thumbnails. Command
line options can be used to specify the width and height of the thumbnails in
character cells. Input images are processed as with
.BR @ABBREV_NAME@-imgcat . \"m2rprog

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -
Read data from standard input. Cannot be used with other filename arguments.

.IP -w,--width\ \fIn\fR
Set the image or thumbnail width to
.I n
character cells.

.IP -h,--height\ \fIn\fR
Set the image or thumbnail height to
.I n
character cells.

.IP -s,--stretch
Request that the image be stretched to fit the display area, rather than
preserving its aspect ratio.

.IP -p,--print
Print filenames with images.

.IP --help
Print basic help

.IP --version
Print version information

.SH NOTES
.I Caution:
There is a size limit on files and images uploaded using these tools.

Currently this limit is 8 MiB, but since file data is Base64 encoded, the actual
maximum size for input files is roughly 6 MB. Furthermore, once uploaded, file
data is kept in the server's memory until the terminal is closed, its scrollback
buffer is cleared, or the insertion point leaves the scrollback buffer.
For these reasons, it is recommended that direct file downloads be used for
fetching files from remote servers. Direct downloads are not subject to a size
limitation and do not consume server memory.

.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
hashes uploaded files and images and only stores one copy of each
uploaded file. Re-displaying the same inline image multiple times in the same
terminal will not consume additional server memory beyond the first instance.

How inline images are displayed and which image formats are supported is left
up to each
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
client. The server simply stores the data for download. Some clients may not
support inline image display or inline downloads. The list of supported
image formats (SVG BMP GIF JPEG PNG PBM PGM PPM XBM XPM) coded into
.B @ABBREV_NAME@-imgcat \"m2rprog
and
.B @ABBREV_NAME@-imgls \"m2rprog
reflects the formats supported by the
.BR @APP_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
client and the
.BR ImageMagick (1) \"m2rman
tools used for preprocessing.
