\- @FRIENDLY_NAME@ information monitor

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @MONITOR_NAME@ \"m2rprog
[\fI--initial\fR|\fI--monitor\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @MONITOR_NAME@ \"m2rprog
is a utility program executed by
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
to monitor the local system for useful information to report to terminal clients.
This includes the hostname, kernel version, time zone, and primary IP address of
the system, but can consist of any number of arbitrary single-line UTF-8
key-value pairs. Run
.B @MONITOR_NAME@ \"m2rprog
from a shell prompt to see what information is reported.

.B @MONITOR_NAME@ \"m2rprog
has two modes of operation. When run with the --initial option, the program
should print lines of the form
"key=value" \"m2rtt
on standard output and then exit
immediately. When run with no arguments, the program should do the same thing,
but may keep running until receipt of
.I SIGTERM
or until its standard input is closed. The intent is for the program to print
an initial set of values on startup in the first mode, then run continuously in
the second mode, printing key-value pairs in response to system changes.

Each
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
instance forks its own instances of
.B @MONITOR_NAME@ \"m2rprog
as necessary. In addition, two customizable scripts,
.I monitor-script
and
.I attr-script
can be used to override or replace
.B @MONITOR_NAME@ \"m2rprog
entirely, see
.B FILES \"m2rsect
below. On receipt of
.IR SIGUSR1 ,
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
restarts the monitor program.

It is possible for terminal clients to send commands to the monitor program,
which will be written to its standard input, followed by a newline.
An advanced monitor program may support commands telling it to report certain
data. For example, the default
.B @MONITOR_NAME@ \"m2rprog
implementation will respond to the command "loadavg" by reporting the system
load average every ten seconds for the next half hour.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP --initial
Print a set of initial key-value pairs immediately and then exit.

.IP --monitor
Run continuously, printing key-value pairs as changes occur, until standard input
is closed or
.I SIGTERM
is received. This is the default behavior.

.IP --help
Print basic help

.IP --version
Print version information

.SH FILES

Programs executed by
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
to set system-specific UTF-8 key-value pairs reported to clients. Only the first
script found using the order shown is executed. The program should print lines of
the form
key=value \"m2rtt
on standard output and must exit quickly. Values output by the
program override the values printed by @MONITOR_NAME@ --initial.
These scripts are optional and are not required to be present.

.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/@SERVER_NAME@/monitor-script \"m2rfile

.I /etc/@SERVER_NAME@/monitor-script \"m2rfile

.I @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/lib/@SERVER_NAME@/monitor-script \"m2rfile

Programs executed by
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
to set system-specific UTF-8 key-value pairs reported to clients. The program
should print lines of the form
key=value \"m2rtt
on standard out and may run as long as
necessary, however it must exit on receipt of
.I SIGTERM
or when its standard input is closed.  Only the first script found
using the order shown is executed, and if a script is found,
.B @MONITOR_NAME@ \"m2rprog
is not executed. These scripts are optional and are not required to be present.

.SH NOTES
The default
.B @MONITOR_NAME@ \"m2rprog
implementation obtains attributes from the files
.BR os-release (5) \"m2rman
and
.BR machine-info (5) \"m2rman
and from calls to
.BR uname (3) \"m2rman
and
.BR getaddrinfo (3). \"m2rman
On Linux,
.BR netlink (7) \"m2rman
is used to monitor for network address changes, and if sd-bus support was
compiled in, the D-Bus interfaces
.I org.freedesktop.hostname1
and
.I org.freedesktop.timedate1
are used to monitor for hostname and timezone changes.

A small number of basic attributes, such as the UID, are set directly by
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
and cannot be changed from the monitor or from scripts.
