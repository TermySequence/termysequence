.SH NAME
.B @CONNECT_NAME@ \"m2rprog
\- Establish connection between @FRIENDLY_NAME@ servers

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @CONNECT_NAME@ \"m2rprog
[\fIoptions\fR] [--] \fIcommand\fR [\fIarg...\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @CONNECT_NAME@ \"m2rprog
is used to establish a connection between a local instance of
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
and an instance running on a different host, as a different user, or in a
container.
.B @CONNECT_NAME@ \"m2rprog
runs a helper program, specified by
.I command
and
.IR args ,
which must itself execute an instance of
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
on the desired remote system and make it accessible over standard input and
standard output. After the handshake from the remote server is received,
.B @CONNECT_NAME@ \"m2rprog
connects to the local
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
instance, sets up the link between the two servers, and exits. File descriptor
passing is used to hand the helper process over to the local server, making it
unnecessary for
.B @CONNECT_NAME@ \"m2rprog
to forward traffic.

Separate convenience scripts are provided for commonly used helper programs:
.BR @ABBREV_NAME@-ssh (1), \"m2rdoc
.BR @ABBREV_NAME@-sudo (1), \"m2rdoc
and
.BR @ABBREV_NAME@-su (1). \"m2rdoc
However, any program that can be used to execute
an instance of 
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
in a remote environment can be used with
.BR @CONNECT_NAME@ . \"m2rprog
The convenience scripts are simple wrappers for
.B @CONNECT_NAME@ \"m2rprog
and are documented further in their own man pages.

Until
.B @CONNECT_NAME@ \"m2rprog
sees a valid
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol handshake, any output produced by the helper program is relayed to
standard output, and standard input is relayed to the helper program (with
terminal echo disabled). This allows passwords, pass phrases, and other input to
be collected from the user to establish the connection. Once the connection is
established and
.B @CONNECT_NAME@ \"m2rprog
has exited, the helper program will be detached from the terminal and running in
the background.

However, a side effect of this feature is that any diagnostic messages printed by
the helper program once the connection is established will interrupt the protocol
stream. Furthermore, the default "raw" encoding of the
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol cannot be used if the helper program interferes with the data stream,
such as by providing escape sequences to interrupt the connection. Helper
programs should be run with appropriate arguments to minimize the number of
messages printed and to (ideally) make the data stream 8-bit safe.
.B @CONNECT_NAME@ \"m2rprog
provides options to change the variant of the
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol used as necessary to ensure a clean connection. See
.B OPTIONS \"m2rsect
below for further details.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -p,--pty
Run
.I command
in a pseudoterminal. Use this option if the helper program expects standard input
to be connected to a terminal.

.IP -P,--nopty
Do not run
.I command
in a pseudoterminal (a socket or pipe is used). This is the default.

.IP -r,--raw
Use the 8-bit "raw" encoding of the
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol. This encoding offers the best performance, but cannot be used if the
data stream is not 8-bit safe. This is the default.

.IP -R,--noraw
Use the 7-bit "term" encoding of the
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol. This encoding uses Base64 encoded terminal escape sequences, and will
function in non-8-bit-safe data streams. It is also somewhat robust against
occasional diagnostic messages being printed into the data stream.

.IP -k,--keepalive\ \fIn\fR
Enable keep-alive probes with a timeout of
.I n
seconds on the connection. A timeout of 0 disables keep-alive probes. The
default timeout is 25 seconds and the minimum (nonzero) timeout is 5 seconds.

.IP -d,--dir\ \fIdir\fR
Start
.I command
in directory
.IR dir .
Relative paths are interpreted relative to
.IR $HOME . \"m2renv
By default
.I $HOME \"m2renv
is used.

.IP -0,--arg0\ \fIarg\fR
Use
.I arg
as the first argument vector element when running
.IR command .

.IP -n,--noosc
Do not issue
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
escape sequences if standard input is a tty. Use when running in a terminal
emulator other than
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1). \"m2rdoc

.IP -t,--runtime\ \fIdir\fR
Look for the per-user local socket in runtime directory
.IR dir .

.IP --help

.IP --version

.SH NOTES
.B @CONNECT_NAME@ \"m2rprog
is an alias for
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ ; \"m2rdoc
both functions are implemented by the same binary.
