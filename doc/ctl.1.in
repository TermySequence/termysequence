.SH NAME
.B @ABBREV_NAME@ctl \"m2rprog
\- Set or clear @FRIENDLY_NAME@ session attributes

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @ABBREV_NAME@ctl \"m2rprog
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIcommand\fR] [\fIarg\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @ABBREV_NAME@ctl \"m2rprog
is used to set and clear various useful attributes from within a
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
terminal session. The effects of setting these attributes will vary depending
on the specific client program being used.

.B @ABBREV_NAME@ctl \"m2rprog
also provides an interface to check the status of and adjust "per-session"
environment variables whose values depend on the terminal's current owning
client.
.I DISPLAY \"m2renv
and
.I SSH_AUTH_SOCK \"m2renv
are examples of environment variables typically managed in this way. Which
variables are considered per-session is controlled by the client program,
typically via terminal profile settings.

.SH COMMANDS
.IP check-env
Check the status of per-session environment variables, if any. The output
consists of a list of variable names along with the value that each variable
should have (according to the terminal's current ownership), the value that
the multiplexer server believes the variable to have (based on when the
environment was last reset), and the value that the variable actually has.

.IP fix-env
Print a set of shell assignment statements which adjust the environment
to correspond to the environment of the connected client which currently owns
the terminal. A reset-env command will also be included if necessary. The
output of this command is suitable for evaluation by the shell using eval.

.IP reset-env
Inform the multiplexer that the terminal's environment has been updated to
match the environment of the connected client which currently owns the
terminal. This command should not be run unless the environment has in fact
been updated. A call to this command will be included in the output of fix-env
when appropriate.

.IP set-icon\ \fIname\fR
Set an icon name for the terminal session. If the client supports this
attribute, the corresponding icon will be displayed with the terminal
thumbnail or otherwise associated with the terminal.

.IP clear-icon
Unset the custom icon name for the terminal session, which will cause the
client to revert to its default behavior for the terminal icon.  Note that
setting the empty string is the same as clearing the icon; to force display
of no icon in
.BR @APP_NAME@ (1), \"m2rdoc
set the name "none".

.IP set-badge\ \fIformat\fR
Set the badge format for the terminal session. This is a text string which
may optionally contain attribute names of the form "\\(name)", which will
be expanded to the attribute's value dynamically. Quote the text if it
contains spaces. Setting the empty string indicates that no badge should
be displayed.

The
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol specifies many useful attributes that can be displayed in terminal
badges, and custom attributes can be set as well. The client may have a means
of inspecting the available attributes, such as the "View Terminal Information"
action within
.BR @APP_NAME@ (1). \"m2rdoc

.IP clear-badge
Unset the custom badge for the terminal session, which will cause the client to
revert to its default behavior for the terminal badge.

.IP set-layout\ \fIspec\fR
This is a
.BR @APP_NAME@ (1)-specific \"m2rdoc
option which sets the layout of the terminal viewport and its supporting
widgets. The argument is a comma-separated list of numbers (without spaces)
where each number refers to a specific widget:

0) the terminal viewport itself
.br
1) marks widget
.br
2) plain scroll bar
.br
3) minimap widget
.br
4) timing widget

The letter "s" may be placed between
numbers in the list to request a separator line. A minus sign in front of
a number will place the widget at the given location but hide it.
Example: "-4,1,s,0,-2,3"

.IP clear-layout
Unset the custom layout for the terminal session, which will cause the client
to revert to the default layout.

.IP set-fills\ \fIspec\fR
This is a
.BR @APP_NAME@ (1)-specific \"m2rdoc
option which sets column fills (vertical lines) at specific column positions in
the terminal viewport. The argument is a comma-separated list of fill
definitions, each taking the form "<\fIcolumn\fR>[:<\fIcolor\fR>]" where
\fIcolumn\fR is the column number at which to place the fill, and \fIcolor\fR is
a 256-color palette index in the range 0 to 255. If color is omitted, the
terminal foreground color is used. Example: "78,80:9"

.IP clear-fills
Unset custom column fills for the terminal session, which will cause the client
to revert to the default fills.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP --help
Print basic help

.IP --version

.IP --man

.SH NOTES
When using
.BR @APP_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
it is possible to manage these settings strictly on the client side using
settings profiles. This script is provided for completeness.

.B @ABBREV_NAME@ctl \"m2rprog
is a wrapper script that uses
.BR @QUERY_NAME@ (1). \"m2rdoc
to set the session attributes. The escape sequences used are specific to
.IR @FRIENDLY_NAME@ .
Running this script under other terminal emulators will have undefined results.
