.SH NAME
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rprog
\- graphical @FRIENDLY_NAME@ terminal multiplexer client

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rprog
[\fIoptions\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rprog
is a graphical multiplexing terminal emulator client implementing the
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol using the
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
multiplexing terminal emulator server.
The emulator aims for
XTerm \"m2rweb
compatibility and supports modern terminal extensions
such as 256-color text, mouse tracking, shell integration, and inline image
display. In addition, the
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol provides many features beyond standard terminal
emulation, including flexible, efficient connectivity between servers,
file monitoring and transfer, and multi-user terminal sharing and collaboration.

On startup, by default
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rprog
will attempt to connect to an already running
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
instance using a per-user local socket. If the server is not already running, it
will be launched. This server instance is intended to be independent of user
login sessions in the manner of
.BR tmux (1) \"m2rman
or
.BR screen (1) \"m2rman
and is referred to as the "persistent user server." Note that terminals launched
on this server will typically lack the environment variables needed to launch
graphical programs on the desktop, such as
.IR DISPLAY . \"m2renv

In addition, by default
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rprog
will launch a second, private
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
instance as a direct child process. This server instance will exit along with
.BR @APP_NAME@ , \"m2rprog
but its terminals
.I will
have access to desktop environment variables such as
.IR DISPLAY . \"m2renv
This server
instance is referred to as the "transient session server."

Connections to additional
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
instances running in containers, on other hosts, or as other users, including
root, can be made from
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rprog
or by using
.BR @CONNECT_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
or its wrapper scripts
.BR @ABBREV_NAME@-ssh (1), \"m2rdoc
.BR @ABBREV_NAME@-su (1), \"m2rdoc
and others.

.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rprog
listens on a per-user local socket of its own, which can be used to launch
remote pipe commands and application actions programmatically using
.BR @PIPE_NAME@ (1). \"m2rdoc

For comprehensive documentation of the many features offered by
.BR @APP_NAME@ , \"m2rprog
refer to the support pages at https://@PRODUCT_DOMAIN@/doc/

.SH OPTIONS
.IP --noplugins
Disable loading all plugins.

.IP --nosysplugins
Disable loading plugins from
.IR @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/@APP_NAME@/plugins . \"m2rfile

.IP -t,--rundir\ \fIdir\fR
Look for the server's local socket under runtime directory
.IR dir .
The specifiers %t and %U, if present, are expanded to the systemd runtime
directory and the user UID respectively. Specifying this option is only
necessary if
.BR @SERVER_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
is launched with a custom runtime directory.

.IP --tmp
Store the application's per-user local socket and other runtime files under
/tmp rather than
.IR $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR . \"m2renv
This is the default unless systemd support is compiled in.

.IP --nofdpurge
Don't look for and close leaked file descriptors on startup. This is useful
when debugging the application with tools such as valgrind.

.IP --version
Print version information

.IP --man
Attempt to show this man page

.SH FILES
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/@APP_NAME@/ \"m2rfile

Location where
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rprog
stores its configuration files.

.I $XDG_DATA_HOME/@APP_NAME@/ \"m2rfile
.br
.I @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/@APP_NAME@/ \"m2rfile

Locations where
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rprog
looks for icons, images, plugins, and other data files.

.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/@APP_NAME@/attr-script \"m2rfile
.br
.I /etc/@APP_NAME@/attr-script \"m2rfile
.br
.I @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/lib/@APP_NAME@/attr-script \"m2rfile

Programs executed by
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rprog
to set client-specific UTF-8 key-value pairs reported to servers and visible to
other clients. The program should print lines of the form
key=value \"m2rtt
and must
exit quickly. These scripts are optional and are not required to be present.

A small number of basic client attributes, such as the UID, are set directly by
.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rprog
and cannot be changed from scripts.

.SH NOTES
When
.BR systemd (1) \"m2rman
is used to manage login sessions, certain administrative commands must be run to
to allow the persistent user server to survive across user login sessions.
Refer to
.BR @SYSTEMD_SETUP_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
for more information.

.B @APP_NAME@ \"m2rprog
has the ability to perform remote file and directory mounts using
.BR fuse (8), \"m2rman
but only if FUSE support was enabled at compile time, the FUSE 3 runtime is
present on the system, and the user has the necessary permissions to establish
unprivileged FUSE mounts.
