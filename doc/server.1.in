.SH NAME
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
\- @FRIENDLY_NAME@ terminal multiplexer server

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
[\fIoptions\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
is a multiplexing terminal emulator server implementing the
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol.
The emulator aims for
XTerm \"m2rweb
compatibility and supports modern terminal extensions
such as 256-color text, mouse tracking, shell integration, and inline image
display. In addition, the
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol provides many features beyond standard terminal
emulation, including flexible, efficient connectivity between servers,
file monitoring and transfer, and multi-user terminal sharing and collaboration.

.I Note:
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
does not provide a text-based user interface in the manner of
.BR tmux (1) \"m2rman
or
.BR screen (1). \"m2rman
A separate client program such as
.BR @APP_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
must be used to interact with the terminals themselves. The client program will
typically launch the server automatically, making it unnecessary to run
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
directly in most cases. The intent is to
separate the display and user interface components from the server, allowing
a single server implementation to support a wide variety of clients, including
clients such as
.BR @APP_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
specifically built for graphical windowing systems.

By default,
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
forks into the background, services
standard input, and listens on a private, per-user Unix-domain socket for
additional connections.
If the socket is found to be already bound to another
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
instance, standard input will be forwarded to the existing server
(using file descriptor
passing when possible to avoid copying overhead). This makes it
possible to run a server using e.g.
.BR ssh (1) \"m2rman
or
.BR sudo (8), \"m2rman
gaining access to an existing multiplexer running on another host or as
another user (see
.BR @CONNECT_NAME@ (1)). \"m2rdoc
When forwarding standard input, the server changes its name to
.BR @FORWARDER_NAME@ . \"m2rprog

The command line options to
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
are used to control the lifecycle of
the server. The default behavior described above can be modified to support
private, standalone servers and socket-only daemon servers, including
socket-activated servers suitable for use with
.BR systemd (1) \"m2rman
per-user instances. In all cases, the server exits on receipt of
.IR SIGTERM ,
.IR SIGINT ,
or
.IR SIGHUP ,
or when all clients have disconnected and all terminals have closed.

Each
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
instance forks a companion process,
.BR @MONITOR_NAME@ (1), \"m2rdoc
to collect system-specific information such as the hostname and IP address.
Three additional customizable programs:
.IR monitor-script ,
.IR attr-script ,
and
.I id-script
are also optionally read by
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
to override the default monitor process, provide additional system-specific
information, and to determine the UUID of the local machine, respectively (see
.B FILES \"m2rsect
below). The system-specific information consists of arbitrary UTF-8 key-value
pairs which can be used to customize terminal appearance within supporting
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
clients such as
.BR @APP_NAME@ (1). \"m2rdoc

.SH OPTIONS
.IP --nofork
Do not fork off a daemon process after startup. Note that even when forking,
if standard input is being serviced, the parent process will remain running
after the fork as long as standard input is active.

.IP --nostdin
Do not treat standard input as a client connection; accept client connections on
the per-user local socket only. If another
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
instance is already listening on the socket, exit immediately.

.IP --activated
Listen on a local socket passed in via systemd socket activation. Implies
--nofork, --nostdin, and --rundir
.IR @SERVER_XDG_DIR@ . \"m2rfile
Won't work unless
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
was compiled with systemd support.

.IP --nolisten
Do not listen on a per-user local socket for additional client connections;
service standard input only. Note that a connection will still be made to the
socket to determine if another
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
instance is already running, and if so, standard input will be forwarded to it
(see --standalone). Implies --nofork.

.IP --standalone
Service standard input without attempting to either listen on or connect to the
per-user local socket. The server (and all terminals) will exit after standard
input is closed. Implies --nofork.

.IP --client
Attempt to connect to an existing
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
instance over the per-user local socket and hand off standard input for
servicing. If no existing instance is listening, exit immediately.

.IP -t,--rundir\ \fIdir\fR
Use runtime directory
.IR dir .
It will be created if necessary, but its parent directory must exist. The
specifiers %t and %U, if present, are expanded to
.I $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR \"m2renv
and the user UID respectively. The default location is
.I @SERVER_TMP_DIR@ \"m2rfile
unless --activated is set, in which case this option is ignored. See
.B NOTES \"m2rsect
below for more information.

.IP --nogit
Disable monitoring for and reporting of git-specific file attributes and branch
information. Only applicable if
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
was compiled with libgit2 support.

.IP --nofdpurge
Don't look for and close leaked file descriptors on startup. This is useful
when debugging the server with tools such as valgrind.

.IP --help

.IP --version

.SH FILES
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/@SERVER_NAME@/id-script \"m2rfile

.I /etc/@SERVER_NAME@/id-script \"m2rfile
.br
.I @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/lib/@SERVER_NAME@/id-script \"m2rfile

Programs executed by
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
to determine the UUID of the local machine. The program should print the UUID on
standard output. By default,
.I /etc/machine-id \"m2rfile
is used; the
.I id-script
programs can be used as an override or replacement for that file. One or the
other must be present; the
.I @FRIENDLY_NAME@
protocol requires each machine to have a unique identifier.

.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/@SERVER_NAME@/attr-script \"m2rfile
.br
.I /etc/@SERVER_NAME@/attr-script \"m2rfile

Programs executed by
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
to set system-specific UTF-8 key-value pairs reported to clients. The program
should print lines of the form key=value and must exit quickly. Refer to
.BR @MONITOR_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
for more information. These scripts are optional and are not required to be
present.

.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/@SERVER_NAME@/monitor-script \"m2rfile
.br
.I /etc/@SERVER_NAME@/monitor-script \"m2rfile

Programs executed by
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
to set system-specific UTF-8 key-value pairs reported to clients. The program
should print lines of the form key=value and may run as long as necessary,
however it must exit on receipt of
.I SIGTERM
or when its standard input is closed. By default
.BR @MONITOR_NAME@ (1) \"m2rdoc
is used for this purpose; the
.I monitor-script
programs can be used as an override or replacement for this program. These
scripts are optional and are not required to be present.

.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
runs the scripts on startup, and re-runs the attribute and monitor scripts on
receipt of
.IR SIGUSR1 .

.SH NOTES
.B @SERVER_NAME@ \"m2rprog
is not intended to be run setuid or setgid, and will exit on startup if it
detects this condition.

When attempting to connect to an existing server, the following
locations are searched for the per-user local socket in this order:

.I @SERVER_XDG_DIR@ \"m2rfile
(only if systemd support is enabled)
.br
.I @SERVER_RUN_DIR@ \"m2rfile
(only if systemd support is enabled)
.br
.I @SERVER_TMP_DIR@ \"m2rfile

The specifiers %t and %U are expanded to
.I $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR \"m2renv
and the user UID respectively.

When listening, the per-user local socket and PID file are placed under
.I @SERVER_XDG_DIR@ \"m2rfile
if --activated is set. Otherwise,
.I @SERVER_TMP_DIR@ \"m2rfile
is used unless changed using the --rundir option.

The server verifies that the runtime directory is owned by the user and has
mode 0700. When making connections over the per-user local socket, the
.I SO_PASSCREDS
socket option is used to verify that the peer has the same UID. Refer to
.BR socket (7) \"m2rman
and
.BR unix (7) \"m2rman
for more information.
